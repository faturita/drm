# DRM
DRM is a handy DLL that you can embed into your programs to provide a very basic DRM system.  

This library works by steganographing the signature inside the same library.

Security is hard, and Crypto is even harder.  If you would like to implmement is library in a very sensitive application, desist to do it.  The purpose of this library is only to server very basic applications that require some basic level of DRM that can be very easily broken.
